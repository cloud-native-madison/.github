# Cloud Native Madison

Welcome to Cloud Native Madison!

We're excited to have you here! Cloud Native Madison is a lively community where tech enthusiasts and professionals come together to explore all things cloud-native â€” from Kubernetes and microservices to containers and beyond. Whether you're just getting started or you've been around the block, you'll find a welcoming space to learn, share, and grow.

We regularly get together to chat about everything from Kubernetes best practices to cloud-native security and CI/CD pipelines. So come join us, dive into some great discussions, and help shape the future of cloud-native technology!

## 2025 Campfire Event Series

The **Campfire Series** is a new initiative by Cloud Native Madison designed to bring our community together â€” where innovators gather to Chat, Circle, and Connect.

Through biweekly "Chat" sessions, monthly "Circle" deep dives, and quarterly "Connect" flagship events, we aim to spark conversations, explore emerging cloud-native trends, and build lasting professional relationships.

This series serves as our platform to reflect on past challenges, share actionable insights, and collaboratively shape the roadmap for 2025 in the cloud-native, DevOps, and security landscape.

ðŸ”¥ **Chat:** Real-time convos and Q&A, every 2nd and 4th Friday of the month  
ðŸ”¥ **Circle:** Monthly deep dives every third Thursday of the month  
ðŸ”¥ **Connect:** Quarterly in-person gatherings for bigger networking and workshops (stay tuned!)
